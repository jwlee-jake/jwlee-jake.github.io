#### Criteria
Guidelines for rating on a 5-point Likert scale for imageability, coherence, and usefulness.

##### Imageability

| Scale      | Explanation                                                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High (5)   | The sentence evokes a vivid and detailed mental image, making it easy to visualize the scene or situation.      |
| Medium (3) | The sentence evokes a reasonable level of imagery: minor inconsistencies may exist, but a mental image forms.   |
| Low (1)    | The sentence lacks substantial imagery, making it challenging to form any meaningful mental image.              |

##### Coherence

| Scale      | Explanation                                                                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High (5)   | The sentence is highly coherent: the meaning is clear, and the wording is natural.                             |
| Medium (3) | The sentence is moderately coherent: minor issues affect clarity in understanding the meaning.                 |
| Low (1)    | The sentence lacks coherence: itâ€™s difficult to understand or read due to illogical structure or grammar.      |

##### Usefulness

| Scale      | Explanation                                                                                                                       |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High (5)   | The sentence is a useful tool for memorizing the vocabulary word; it effectively aids in remembering or is imagined to aid others.|
| Medium (3) | The sentence has minor issues impacting its usefulness, but it could be helpful with some modifications.                          |
| Low (1)    | This sentence is not useful at all.                                                                                               |

#### Keyword Mnemonics
