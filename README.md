## Research Experience  

### Ph.D. Research in Generative AI and NLP  
**University of Massachusetts, Amherst**  
2022.9 - present  
- **Keyword Mnemonics Generation Using LLMs (EMNLP 2024)**  
Developed an LLM-based pipeline to generate cognitive psychology-based mnemonic aids for vocabulary learning. Designed and ran human evaluations and automated assessments to benchmark LLM-generated mnemonics against manually created ones.  
- **Automated Distractor Generation in Math MCQs (NAACL 2024)**  
Explored the use of in-context learning with LLMs for generating distractors in math multiple-choice questions. Conducted experiments to evaluate both model and educator performance.

### Deep Learning and Processing-in-Memory (PIM) Research  
**Korea University, Seoul**  
2019.1 - 2022.2  
- **Optimized Deep Learning Inference on PIM Platforms (ACM TODAES 2024)**  
Developed an ONNX Runtime interface for PIM platforms, optimizing DNN partitioning on both x86 and ARM architectures. Designed profiling and scheduling algorithms to improve inference performance on heterogeneous platforms.
